    <h1>Toasted Bread Crumbs</h1>
    <p><em>by Chef Glenn Rolnick</em></p>
    <p>This quick and inexspensive topping goes well on salads, meatloafs, and other dishes. This recipe appears in <em>Carmine's Celebrates</em></p>
    <h2>Total Time</h2>
    <p>Under 30 minutes</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 slices white bread, crusts removed</li>
        <li>4 teaspoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon chopped garlic</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons grated Romano cheese</li>
        <li>3 teaspoons chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Dry the bread on a cooling rack, uncovered, overnight. Pulse the dried bread in a food processor until chopped into fine crumbs.</li>
        <li>Preheat a large sauté pan over medium-high heat. Add the olive oil and garlic and sauté until the garlic is lightly browned.</li>
        <li>Add the bread crumbs, reduce the heat to medium, and sauté until the crumbs take on an even brown color; do not burn. Toss the bread crumbs frequently; the process should take about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Transfer the bread crumbs to a plate and let cool. When the crumbs are at room temperature, combine them in a bowl with the cheese and parsley and toss to mix. Store in a tightly covered container in a cool, dry place until ready to use. They will keep for about a week.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Enjoy!</strong></p>
